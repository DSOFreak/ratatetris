# Issues

## Graphics & Sound

- Add sound...
- Add menu screen
- Add remove line animation

## Game Logic

- Improve Tetromino roatation logic (push away from walls instead of not rotating)
- Improve gameover logic
- freezing at the top of the board seems buggy

## Missing Features

- Level Progression
- Highscore

## Other

- Check if some "smart"-shuffle algorithem is used in the original
  - Yes modern tetris apperently they use a "7-Bag Randomizer" -> I want that too!
  - The original is truly random
- Code cleanup
