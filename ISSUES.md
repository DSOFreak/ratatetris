# Issues

## Graphics & Sound

- Add sound...
- Add menu screen
- Add remove line animation

## Game Logic

- [x] Improve Tetromino rotation logic (push away from walls instead of not rotating)
- [x] Improve gameover logic
- [x] freezing at the top of the board seems buggy

## Missing Features

- [x] Level Progression
- [x] Highscore

## Other

- [x] Check if some "smart"-shuffle algorithm is used in the original
  - [x] Yes modern Tetris apparently they use a "7-Bag Randomizer" -> I want that too!
  - The original is truly random
- [x] Code cleanup
